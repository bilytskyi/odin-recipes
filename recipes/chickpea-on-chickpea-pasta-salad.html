        <ul>
            <li>1 (6.5 ounce) jar roasted red peppers, 1 tablespoon liquid reserved</li>
            <li>1 (6 ounce) jar sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil, 1 tablespoon liquid reserved</li>
            <li>½ (12 ounce) jar marinated eggplant strips, 1 tablespoon liquid reserved</li>
            <li>1 (3.25 ounce) container pickled Greek pepperoncini, 1 tablespoon liquid reserved</li>
            <li>2 cups chickpeas, drained and rinsed</li>
            <li>1 cup goat cheese marinated in olive oil, drained</li>
            <li>1 cup pitted kalamata olives, drained</li>
            <li>½ cup red onion, diced</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut red peppers, sun-dried tomatoes, eggplants, and pepperoncini into bite-sized pieces. Place cut vegetables in a large bowl. Add chickpeas, goat cheese, olives, and onion.</li>
            <li>Whisk olive oil and saffron together in a small bowl. Add the reserved liquids from the peppers, tomatoes, eggplant, and pepperoncini.</li>
            <li>Grind lemon balm, basil, parsley, and thyme in a mortar until coarse. Add pine nuts and grind into a chunky paste. Whisk the saffron-oil mixture until combined; pour over the vegetable-cheese mixture. Cover and refrigerate.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add fusilli, stir once, and boil until just tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and toss with 1 tablespoon olive oil; do not rinse. Spread pasta into a single layer on a large baking sheet and let cool, at least 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add cooled pasta to the vegetable mixture. Gently toss to coat. Be careful not to stir the pasta as it might fall apart.</li>
        </ol>
